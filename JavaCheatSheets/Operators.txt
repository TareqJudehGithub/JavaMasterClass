Operators
 - Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
 - Assignment Operators
    = is the Assignment operator
      - int number = 5;
  
- Arithmetic Operators
    + add
     - Used in addition operations and also in strings concatenations.
    - subtract
     - Used  in subtraction operations
    * multiple
     - Used in multiplication operations
    / division

    % remainder
     - returns the remainder of an operation
     5 % 3 = 2
     4 % 2 = 0



 - Unary Operators
    int price = -(-5);
    >>> 5

    ++ increments value by 1
     int number = 5;
     number ++;
     number value is increased by 1   5 + 1 = 6

    -- decreases value by 1;

    += add value
     number += 10;

    -=, *= does the same.


 - Equality and Relational Operators

    ! inverts the value of a boolean

    boolean isRaining = true;
    !isRaining = false;

    == double equals compares two values or variables.

    > greater than
    < smaller than
    => equal or greater than
    =< equal or smaller than
    != not equal to
    instanceof data type comparison
      
 - Ternary Operators
  variableName = expression? value1 : value2;

 - Logical Operators
 
 - Operators in Java are special symbols that perform specific operations on
   one, two, or three operands, and return a result. 
    + - * / && || !=
 - Operand. an object that it manipulated by an operator. 
    int sum = 5 + 10 = 15; In this 
 - Operators in an expression indicates which operations to apply to the operands.
 - Associativity. Associativity is the direction of execution of operators and can
   be either left to right or right to left. associativity decides the order in 
   which operators are evaluated.
 AND &&
  AND combines two or more expressions.
    - Returns true if all expressions were true, otherwise it returns false.

  OR  ||
    - AND combines two or more expressions.
    - Returns true if at least one of the expressions is true.

 - NOT !
   - Not turns an expression into it's opposite value.
  
 Order of Operations (for Logical Operators)
  - The ! operator will be evaluated first, then &&, and finally ||. 
  - To change the order of operations you can surround expressions in 
    parentheses.
  
  So, the order of operations is:

    1. Parentheses
    2. NOT !
    3. AND &&
    4. OR ||
