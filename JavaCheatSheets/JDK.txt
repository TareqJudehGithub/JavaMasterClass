Java Development Kit (JDK)
  JDK includes two main tools:
    1 - Java Runtime Environment (RJE)
      - JRE is needed to run any java applications on web pages.
      - Includes the code behind all the variables types and built-in functions
        (ex. the println() function).
      - Includes Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java code to run on any
        platform.

    2 - Java Compiler (javac)
        - javac is needed to develop programs and apps in java.
        - A Compiler is a special type of program that translates programming 
          language (source) code into code (machine code) that a computer can 
          understand and execute.
        - javac (the Java Compiler) reads source code, and translates it into
          Bytecode.
        - The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in return, converts Bytecode into Machine 
          code (0s and 1s). JVM is compatible with any OS its on. So Java programs
          can run on any device.

        Java (source) code => Compiler (javac) => Bytecode => JVM => Machine Code

  - javac compiles the code, while java runs it.


  Compilers
 - A programming language can be understood by both humans and compilers.
 - A compiler is a special program that converts a program written in a 
   programming language into a series of machine codes." 
 - A programmer usually writes a program in a programming language and then 
   runs a compiler, which turns the program code files written by the programmer 
   into a single file with machine code â€“ the final (compiled) program.  
   Program in C++  ==> Compiler  ==>  Machine code 
 - A Java compiler doesn't compile all the classes into one machine-code program. 
 - Java complier compiles every class independently  into a special intermediate 
   code (bytecode).
 - The bytecode is compiled into machine code when the program is started.
 - Java virtual machine (JVM)  must be started first when you need to run a 
   bytecode program.
 - JVM will compile the bytecode into machine code before the program is 
   executed.
 - This approach allows programs written in Java to be run on virtually any 
   device: computers, smartphones, ATMs, toasters, or even credit cards!
 - JVM is the reason why all Android programs are also written in Java.
