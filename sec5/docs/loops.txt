Loops 
 - While Loop
    - While loop keeps iterating until a certain condition is no longer met.
    - while loops allow you to repeat an if condition over and over for as long as that 
      condition remains true, hence the name while!
    
- For loop
    - floor loop iterate over all elements or until a condition is met.
    for loop structure => (loop counter; loop condition; increment counter)
        loop body - action;

- An infinite loop is a loop that never ends.
