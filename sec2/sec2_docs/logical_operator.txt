Logical Operators
 - Operators in Java are special symbols that perform specific operations on
   one, two, or three operands, and return a result. 
    + - * / && || !=
 - Operand. an object that it manipulated by an operator. 
    int sum = 5 + 10 = 15; In this 
 - Operators in an expression indicates which operations to apply to the operands.
 - Associativity. Associativity is the direction of execution of operators and can
   be either left to right or right to left. associativity decides the order in 
   which operators are evaluated.
 AND &&
  AND combines two or more expressions.
    - Returns true if all expressions were true, otherwise it returns false.

  OR  ||
    - AND combines two or more expressions.
    - Returns true if at least one of the expressions is true.

 - NOT !
   - Not turns an expression into it's opposite value.
  
 Order of Operations (for Logical Operators)
  - The ! operator will be evaluated first, then &&, and finally ||. 
  - To change the order of operations you can surround expressions in 
    parentheses.
  
  So, the order of operations is:

    1. Parentheses
    2. NOT !
    3. AND &&
    4. OR ||
