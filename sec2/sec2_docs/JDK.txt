Java Development Kit (JDK)
  JDK includes two main tools:
    1 - Java Runtime Enviroment (RJE)
      - JRE is needed to run any java applications on web pages.
      - Includes the code behind all the variables types and built-in functions
        (ex. the println() function).
      - Includes Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java code to run on any
        platform.

    2 - Java Compiler (javac)
        - javac is needed to develop programs and apps in java.
        - A Compiler is a special type of program that translates programming 
          language (source) code into code (machine code) that a computer can 
          understand and execute.
        - javac (the Java Compiler) read source code, and translates it into
          Bytecode.
        - The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)in return, converts Bytecode into Machine 
          code (0s and 1s). JVM is compatible with any OS its on. So Java programs
          can run on any device.

        Java (source) code => Compiler (javac) => Bytecode => JVM => Machine Code

  - javac compiles the code, while java runs it.
