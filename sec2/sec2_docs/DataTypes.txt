Data Types in Java

 int   up to 2147483647
 Long  between 2147483647*10000000

- long can slow down programs.
- both int and long can store negatives but not fractional.
- double accepts fractional. Slows down programs.
  - In division, one of the numbers at least should be typed as double, or the
    result will return as an int
     double division = 5/2.5;  => 2.5
- String stores text values.
  - When defining Strings, we need to use double quotes around the text, like 
    this:
    String name = "Adam";
  - Single quotes are used for defining single characters, like this:
    char grade = ’A’;
    
- char stores single letters.
- boolean stores true or false values.


Primitive Types in Java
  int
  boolean
  byte
  char
  short
  long 
  float
  double


  Overflow and underflow   
    Overflow is to try and use a number over the max limit, while underflow
    is to try and use a number below the min limit. 
    


  byte
    - A byte occupies 8 bits (1 byte). So we say that a byte has a width of 8.

  Short 
    - Occupies 16 bits (2 bytes), therefor it has a width of 16.

  int
   - occupies 32 bits (4 bytes), therefor it has a width of 32.
   - int max value is 2.14 billion.

  long
   -  occupies 64 bits (8 bytes), therefor it has a width of 64.
    long myLongValue = 100L; 
    We must include an uppercase next to long values.
  boolean

Floating Point Numbers
 - Floating point numbers also known as real numbers.
 - Floating point numbers are usually used for more precision
   calculations.
 - float & double are examples of floating point numbers.
 
  - float 
    - A single precision float number. 
    - Occupies 32 bits (4 bytes).
      float someNum = 5f;
 
  - double. 
    - A double precision float number.
    - Occupies 64 bits (8 bytes).
      double someNum = 5d;
  
  - char
    - char stores a single character.
    - char Occupies 1 byte (8 bits), but in Java a char occupies 16 bits (2 bytes);
      and that is because it allows us to store Unicode characters.

  - boolean
   - boolean evaluates an expression and return wether a true of false value.
  
  - String
   - In Java, String is not considered as a primitive type, but a class.
   - A String is a sequence of characters.
   - When concatenating a String with an int, Java converts to int to a String.
   - Strings are immutable.
      
   - Occupies 


  The most common data types used in Java are int, String, double, and bool.

  *** If we did not specify letter (L, f, and d) after that respective values,
  these long, float, and double values will  be treated as integers.
