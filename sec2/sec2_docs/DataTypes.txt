Data Types in Java

 int   up to 2147483647
 Long  between 2147483647*10000000

- long can slow down programs.
- both int and long can store negatives but not fractional.
- double accepts fractional. Slows down programs.
  - In division, one of the numbers at least should be typed as double, or the
    result will return as an int
     double division = 5/2.5;  => 2.5
- String stores text values.
  - When defining Strings, we need to use double quotes around the text, like 
    this:
    String name = "Adam";
  - Single quotes are used for defining single characters, like this:
    char grade = ’A’;
    
- char stores single letters.
- boolean stores true or false values.

  Overflow and underflow   
    Overflow is to try and use a number over the max limit, while underflow
    is to try and use a number below the min limit. 
    


  byte
    - A byte occupies 8 bits. So we say that a byte has a width of 8.

  Short 
    - Occupies 16 bits, therefor it has a width of 16.

  int
   - occupies 32 bits, therefor it has a width of 32.

  long
   -  occupies 64 bits, therefor it has a width of 64.
    long myLongValue = 100L; 
    We must include an uppercase next to long values.
  boolean
