Variables
  - Variables are special entities used to store data.
  - In Java, all data is stored in variables.
  - In Java, every variable has three important properties: type, name, and 
    value.
  - A variable's type determines the kinds of values/data that can be stored 
     in it.
  - The value is the specific object, data, or information stored in the 
    variable.
  - Every object in Java has a certain type. Some examples include integer, 
    fractional number, text, Cat, House, etc.
  - A variable also has a type. It can only store values whose type is the same 
    as its own.
  - Expression. Expression is a construct that evaluates a single value. It is 
    formed by combining variables, literals, methods that return values, and 
    operators.
      name = "John Smith"; 
      int myValue = 10 + 5;
      "John Smith" and  10 + 5 in the above example is an expression. 
      
  - To create (or declare) a variable, we use the name of the type: 
      TypeName variableName
    
  -To declare a variable:
      int num;
      String name;
      double num2;
    
     // multiple declaration:
      int a, b, c;

     
  - Initialize a variable, is basically giving our variable an initial value.
     // Initialize a variable example:
     name = "John Smith"; 
     "John Smith" in the above example is an expression. 

  - Doubles are fractional, or real, numbers.
  - We use a special operation (assignment) to assign values to variables.
  - Assignment copies values from one variable into another.
    Example:
      = is an assignment operator.

      // Assign the value 3 to variable num1
      int num1 = 3;

      int num2 = num1 + 1;

  - Variable names in Java follow camelCase (pascal) naming convention.
  - Variable names cannot contain spaces, +, -, etc. It's best to just use 
    letters and numbers in a variableâ€™s name.
  - Variable names do not accept a number as the first letter.
  - boolean naming convention usually start with isVarName.
  - Java is strongly typed, meaning you cannot change/update value type for a defined
    variable.
  - Java is case sensitive.  int number; is not int Number;
  
  - Updating variables
   num1 = num1 + 5;
   num1 = 10;

  
  String Variable
   - A variable for storing string values.
    
    // Declare a bus driver variable
    String driver;

    // Initialize driver variable with a name string value
    driver = "Hamish";
      - "Hamish" here is a string literal, a string refers to the name Hamish.
      - A String literal in Java, is any sequence of characters surrounded by
        double quotes. It's value cannot be changed, unlike a variable.

    // assignment statement (also known as just statement)
    int emailAddress = "john@email.com";
